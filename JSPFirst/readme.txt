	HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM
	
	1.	The hotel reservation system allows the user to book rooms in the hotel through online.The system is intended for the users to simplify the task of online booking of the rooms in the hotel.
	
	
	2.	The website is designed using HTML,JSP and SQL. The website allows the first time user to register into the system and already registered users to login into the system.
	
	
	3.	The user can login into the system in order to enter the hotel’s homepage.The username and password are validated from the actual values in the registration database table.The hotel’s homepage gets displayed after the login.The webpage contains booking, gallery and map tabs.
	
	
	4.	The gallery page displays the room’s pictures in sliding view to the customers.The about us page gives the information related to the hotel. Within the page, there exists an option to allow the user to guide them on the direction to the hotel. 
        5.      In the booking page, the user is allowed to fill the details for his/her reservation of the hotel rooms. Once the user successfully has made the booking, the user can logout of the site.
	
	
	6.	The proposed system requires 3 database tables in SQL in order to store the details gathered in every page.These three databases are created within Java netbeans. 
	
	
	7.	JSP is platform independent and implemented all over the project as it’s easier to develop.JSP and SQL supports in the creation and maintenance of  database and tables.
	
	
	The project was developed as a part of the curriculum for the course IP lab(CS405).
